This Flycheck extension configures Flycheck automatically for the current
Cargo project.

Setup
-----

Install from [MELPA][] or [MELPA Stable][].

If you use [`Cask`][cask]:

```emacs-lisp
(source gnu)
(source melpa)

(depends-on "flycheck-rust")
```

Then, in your `init.el`:

```emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'rust-mode
  (add-hook 'flycheck-mode-hook #'flycheck-rust-setup))
```

Usage
-----

Just use Flycheck as usual in your Rust/Cargo projects.  `flycheck-rust-setup`
will call `cargo` to determine your project layout and set the variables needed
by the `rust-cargo` checker to properly check your buffer.

You may also want to have a look at [flycheck/flycheck-inline][flycheck-inline],
which works well with diagnostics emitted by Rust.
