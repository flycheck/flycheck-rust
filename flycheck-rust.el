;;; Commentary:

;; This Flycheck extension configures Flycheck automatically for the current
;; Cargo project.
;;
;; # Setup
;;
;;     (add-hook 'flycheck-mode-hook #'flycheck-rust-setup)
;;
;; # Usage
;;
;; Just use Flycheck as usual in your Rust/Cargo projects.
;;
;; Note: You must run `cargo build` initially to install all dependencies.  If
;; you add new dependencies to `Cargo.toml` you need to run `cargo build`
;; again. Otherwise you will see spurious errors about missing crates.
